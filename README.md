## About

This repository contains Python solutions to various problems from Project Euler. Each solution is crafted to be efficient, using Python's libraries and sometimes custom algorithms to solve the problems.

## Project Euler

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical and computational problems that require creative and optimized solutions. The problems can range from simple arithmetic to complex mathematical theory.

Check out the Project Euler website [here](https://projecteuler.net/).

## Structure

Each solution is saved as a separate Python file, named according to the problem number (e.g., `problem_001.py` for problem 1). The solutions are written to be easily readable, with comments explaining key logic steps.
