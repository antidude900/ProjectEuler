# Project Euler Solutions in Python

Welcome to my collection of solutions for [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems, implemented in Python.


## About

This repository contains Python solutions to various problems from Project Euler. Each solution is crafted to be efficient and pass all the test cases in HackerRank.


## Structure

Each solution is saved as a separate Python file, named according to the problem number (e.g., `Problem1.py` for problem 1). The code is well explained with comments providing mathematical theory, thought process and examples.


## Project Euler

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical and computational problems that require creative and optimized solutions. The problems can range from simple arithmetic to complex mathematical theory.

## HackerRank

HackerRank offers multiple test cases for each problem, allowing you to identify flaws in your code and optimize it for better performance.
